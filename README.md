# GalacticRunner
Galactic Runner is a python based, 2D arcade game that lets the player foray into different worlds where the objective is simple, SURVIVE. This game has been made using the PyGame game engine which denies incorporation of complex and much more versatile gaming engines like Unity or Unreal and uses almost raw coding as its premise. That being said, it might also be seen as a recreational game for nerds such as us, and joyful experimentation of Python’s core capabilities.

Choosing engine and libraries: The first task was to choose a platform and subsequently an engine that would satisfy our presumed aspirations concerning the game. After stumbling upon many such platforms, we ended up choosing the PyGame gaming engine because of its simple yet powerful methods of 2D rendering. Furthermore, the group’s pre-requisite skill of Python made the choice that much more tempting.
